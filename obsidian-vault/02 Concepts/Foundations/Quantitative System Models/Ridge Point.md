# Ridge Point

The arithmetic intensity at which a roofline's bandwidth and compute ceilings meet, equal to peak compute throughput divided by peak memory bandwidth.

## Book Passages

These are explicitly recorded related passages from the upstream draft alignment; they do not certify complete coverage.

No explicit passage alignment is recorded for this concept. Subject reading pointers are available in its browsing home.

## Conditional Relationships

These are the taxonomy's draft editorial relationships. Read each relationship with its condition; an outgoing link is not a prerequisite claim.

- Separates [[02 Concepts/Foundations/Quantitative System Models/Compute Bound vs. Memory Bound|Compute Bound vs. Memory Bound]]. **Condition:** Throughput and bandwidth ceilings are measured for the same device and memory level.

- Is the corner of [[02 Concepts/Foundations/Quantitative System Models/Roofline Bound|Roofline Bound]]. **Condition:** Both ceilings refer to the same device and memory level.
