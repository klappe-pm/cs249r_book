# Generalization

Performance on relevant examples or conditions beyond those used to fit the system.

## Browsing Home

[[02 Concepts/Lifecycle/Model Evaluation & Testing/Metrics, Calibration & Uncertainty Subject|Metrics, Calibration & Uncertainty]] → [[02 Concepts/Lifecycle/Model Evaluation & Testing/Model Evaluation & Testing Index|Model Evaluation & Testing]]

This is a background concept on which ML systems reasoning depends; that classification does not make it optional.

## Book Passages

These are explicitly recorded related passages from the upstream draft alignment; they do not certify complete coverage.

No explicit passage alignment is recorded for this concept. Subject reading pointers are available in its browsing home.

## Conditional Relationships

These are the taxonomy's draft editorial relationships. Read each relationship with its condition; an outgoing link is not a prerequisite claim.

- Lowers the advantage of [[02 Concepts/Qualities/Security & Privacy/Membership Inference|Membership Inference]]. **Condition:** Attack advantage grows with the train-test generalization gap, so better-generalizing models leak less membership signal.

## Themes
