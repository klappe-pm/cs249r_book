# Prediction Logging

Recording requests, model versions, outputs, and later outcomes so production behavior can be analyzed, debugged, and reused as data.

## Book Passages

These are explicitly recorded related passages from the upstream draft alignment; they do not certify complete coverage.

No explicit passage alignment is recorded for this concept. Subject reading pointers are available in its browsing home.

## Conditional Relationships

These are the taxonomy's draft editorial relationships. Read each relationship with its condition; an outgoing link is not a prerequisite claim.

- Can increase exposure to [[02 Concepts/Qualities/Security & Privacy/Privacy Leakage|Privacy Leakage]]. **Condition:** Holds when logs retain personal inputs or outputs without redaction, access control, or retention limits.

- Joins predictions to later outcomes with [[02 Concepts/Lifecycle/Deployment & Serving/Request Correlation Keys|Request Correlation Keys]]. **Condition:** Outcomes arrive after the prediction and must be matched.
