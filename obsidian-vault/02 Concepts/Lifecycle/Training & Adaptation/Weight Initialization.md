# Weight Initialization

Choosing the scale and distribution of initial parameters so that activations and gradients keep stable variance through depth at the start of training.

## Browsing Home

[[02 Concepts/Lifecycle/Training & Adaptation/Optimization & Training Dynamics Subject|Optimization & Training Dynamics]] → [[02 Concepts/Lifecycle/Training & Adaptation/Training & Adaptation Index|Training & Adaptation]]

This is a background concept on which ML systems reasoning depends; that classification does not make it optional.

## Book Passages

These are explicitly recorded related passages from the upstream draft alignment; they do not certify complete coverage.

No explicit passage alignment is recorded for this concept. Subject reading pointers are available in its browsing home.

## Conditional Relationships

These are the taxonomy's draft editorial relationships. Read each relationship with its condition; an outgoing link is not a prerequisite claim.

- Prevents early [[02 Concepts/Lifecycle/Training & Adaptation/Training Instability|Training Instability]]. **Condition:** Networks are deep and use rectifier or residual blocks.

## Search Terms

Upstream search terms may be related terms rather than exact synonyms: Xavier initialization; He initialization.
