# Numerical Nondeterminism

Run-to-run variation in floating-point results because non-associative reductions change order with atomics, kernel selection, parallel layout, batch composition, or hardware.

## Book Passages

These are explicitly recorded related passages from the upstream draft alignment; they do not certify complete coverage.

No explicit passage alignment is recorded for this concept. Subject reading pointers are available in its browsing home.

## Conditional Relationships

These are the taxonomy's draft editorial relationships. Read each relationship with its condition; an outgoing link is not a prerequisite claim.

- Limits [[02 Concepts/Lifecycle/MLOps & Operations/Experiment Reproducibility|Experiment Reproducibility]]. **Condition:** Bitwise reproducibility requires fixing kernels, reduction order, parallel layout, and hardware, not only random seeds.
