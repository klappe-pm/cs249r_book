# Silent Data Corruption

Hardware producing wrong computational results without raising an error or crash, so the corruption propagates undetected.

## Book Passages

These are explicitly recorded related passages from the upstream draft alignment; they do not certify complete coverage.

No explicit passage alignment is recorded for this concept. Subject reading pointers are available in its browsing home.

## Conditional Relationships

These are the taxonomy's draft editorial relationships. Read each relationship with its condition; an outgoing link is not a prerequisite claim.

- Can inject the corrupted gradients or weights behind [[02 Concepts/Lifecycle/Training & Adaptation/Training Instability|Training Instability]]. **Condition:** When a miscomputed value propagates into optimizer state before any check catches it, so a loss spike or divergence appears with no software cause.

## Search Terms

Upstream search terms may be related terms rather than exact synonyms: SDC.
