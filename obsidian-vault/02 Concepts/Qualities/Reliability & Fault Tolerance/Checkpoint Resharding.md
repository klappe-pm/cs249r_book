# Checkpoint Resharding

Loading a checkpoint saved under one parallel layout or world size into another by remapping sharded tensors, needed for elastic restarts and training-to-serving handoff.

## Book Passages

These are explicitly recorded related passages from the upstream draft alignment; they do not certify complete coverage.

No explicit passage alignment is recorded for this concept. Subject reading pointers are available in its browsing home.

## Conditional Relationships

These are the taxonomy's draft editorial relationships. Read each relationship with its condition; an outgoing link is not a prerequisite claim.

- Remaps between layouts of [[02 Concepts/Stack/Parallelism & Distributed Execution/Training State Sharding|Training State Sharding]]. **Condition:** Requires checkpoints that record each shard's global tensor coordinates rather than rank-local layouts.

## Search Terms

Upstream search terms may be related terms rather than exact synonyms: universal checkpoint; distributed checkpoint.
