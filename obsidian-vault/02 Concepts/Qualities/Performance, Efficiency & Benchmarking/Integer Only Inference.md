# Integer Only Inference

Executing a quantized model with integer arithmetic throughout its operator graph, including accumulation and rescaling, so no floating-point operations are needed at inference time.

## Book Passages

These are explicitly recorded related passages from the upstream draft alignment; they do not certify complete coverage.

No explicit passage alignment is recorded for this concept. Subject reading pointers are available in its browsing home.

## Conditional Relationships

These are the taxonomy's draft editorial relationships. Read each relationship with its condition; an outgoing link is not a prerequisite claim.

- Runs on values represented by [[02 Concepts/Qualities/Performance, Efficiency & Benchmarking/Quantization|Quantization]]. **Condition:** When every operator executes in integer arithmetic.

## Search Terms

Upstream search terms may be related terms rather than exact synonyms: integer-only quantization; fixed-point inference; dyadic rescaling.
